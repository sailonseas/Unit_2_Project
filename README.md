 List Pagination and Filtering
 
Note to reviewer: I am shooting for an "Exceeds expectations" score.

This application has the following features:

 1. Search students by:
    a. First name.
    b. Last name.
    c. Middle name.
    d. Whole name
    e. Email address
    
 2. It also provides the ability to change the number of items per page by modifying the numPerPage variable (defaulted to 10).
